   - Polygon: a plane defined by discrete straight line segments
   - Convex polygon: a polygon is convex when any two points in its plane can be
     joined by a line that does not leave the plane (i.e. the polygon contains
     the whole line segment).
*** Triangle
    - Area of a triangle:
      $A = 1/2 |\vec{a}||\vec{b}| sin(\theta)$
      $A = 1/2 \vec{a} \times \vec{b}$
      (invoking cross product definition)
