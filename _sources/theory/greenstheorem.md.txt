# Green's Theorem

-   The radiation and diffraction potentials can be represented by the potential
    formulation of Green's theorem:
    
	$$
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Green}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      2 \pi \\
      4 \pi
    \end{pmatrix} \phi + \int \int_{S_b} \phi G_{n\xi} dS_{\xi}
    = \int \int_{S_b} \phi_n G dS_{\xi}
    \end{equation}
	$$

-   The Green function, $G(\vec{\xi}, \vec{x})$, corresponds to the potential
    of an oscillatory source, located at the point $\vec{\xi}=\vec{x}$ (where
    $\vec{\xi}$ is the position vector of a point on the body's surface and
    $\vec{x}$ is the position vector of a point within the fluid domain).
